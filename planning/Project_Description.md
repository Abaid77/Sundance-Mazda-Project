## Project Title 
  Sundance Mazda

## Project Description
  Our app will be for a single dealership. It will allow users to browse inventory, select a vehicle and purchase it online.

## Target Audience
  After discussion with the manager of Sundance Mazda the biggest issue they had with their website was that a user could not acctually purchase the vehicle completly onlne. We want to target that user that want to make there purchase online with minimal interaction with dealership staff. He also mentioned some styling concerns.
